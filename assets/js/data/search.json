From there you’ll reunite with some familiar faces at the Crystaline mean. After a cute cutscene or two, you’ll be rewarded with a Splendorous Coffer that will take the shape of whatever main hand that is for the DoL/DoH class you were on when you opened it.Much like your local drug dealer, the first one is free and only enough to get you hooked. You’ll need to cough up some scrips for the rest of the set - 1500 White Scrips per Tool. Honestly, diabolical marketing by Mowen and the rest of the House of Splendors here. Does my little lala heart good~Upgrading to Augmented Splendorous ToolsChora-Zoi is excited to begin improvements on those Splendorus tools you just received. So excited, in fact, she has a quest for you! Quest NPC Location A Dedicated Tool Chora-Zoi Crystarium (X:10.5, Y:7.7) CraftersEach Connoisseur’s turn-in will reqire items you can only obtain with, you guessed it, 50 White Scrips per item. Plan to use a total of at least 1000 White Scrips per Job on this step. Thankfully these aren’t Expert Crafts, so you’re safe from that torture… for now…20 ‘Perfect’ collectable crafts (+900 Collectablity) should net you the 60 items you need for your job. Otherwise you’ll find yourself crafting 60 items to get the 60 splenderous components. If you find yourself barely meeting the requirements for the task, make sure to use Food and Tinctures/Draughts to help you reach better heights!GatherersFor your Miner and Botanist jobs, you’ll need to collect 180 of Connoisseur’s Primstone &amp; Connoisseur’s Wattle Petribark, respectively, while using your new Splendorous tools. Thier locations can be found by following the links or by checking out your Gathering Log in game, under the Sidequest section.For your Fishing task, you’ll be catching 120 fish instead. With your Splendorous Rod equipped, you’ll need to net yourself a Clavekeeper (+283 Collectablity) or Platinum Seahorse (+47 Collectablity) using a Select Bait Ball - convienently available from Quinnana for 5 Scrips, each. Make sure to turn on Collect before your first cast!By using your resources efficently, such as using Patience II, food, and cordials, you can double your Splendorous Fishing Reel Components that you get for higher collectability.Upgrading to Crystalline ToolsAfter obtaining your first Augmented Splendorous Tool, you’ll be able to undertake another quest from Chroa-Zoi. You’ll only be able to do one job at a time, however Chora-Zoi is eager to continue improving the Splendrous Tools. Something tells me this should be quick and easy! Quest NPC Location An Adaptive Tool Chora-Zoi Crystarium (X:10.5, Y:7.7) CraftersAlmost identical to the previous step, you’ll be required to turn in a few more items than last time. Plan to use a total of 1500 White Scrips per Job at least on this step.30 ‘Perfect’ collectable crafts (+1100 Collectablity) should net you the 90 items you need for your job. Otherwise you’ll find yourself crafting 90 items to get the 90 splenderous components.GatherersFor your Miner and Botanist jobs, you’ll need to collect 180 of Connoisseur’s Red Malachite &amp; Connoisseur’s Levin Mint (+570 Collectability), respectively, while using your new Augmented Splendorous tools. Thier locations can be found by following the links or by checking out your Gathering Log in game, as done previously.Fishers, you’ll be catching fish once more (Surprise!). With your Augmented Splendorous Rod equipped, you’ll need to net yourself a Spangled Pirarucu (+425 Collectability) or Mirror Image (+9 Collectablity) this time, still using a Select Bait Ball - available from Quinnana for 5 Scrips, each. Remember to have Collect on and use your skills!Getting White ScripsDon’t forget those weekly Custom Deliveries!If you forgot that M’naago, Adkiragh, Kai-Shirr, and the others existed - don’t worry I get a bit distracted with saving the world and all too! If you’re low on scrips and want a quick boost to get you started, these weekly quests are a great way to get a jump on things. Even if you decide that these weekly quests are the only way you’re making any sort of scrip income, its a great passive way to get a relic or two done a week.Collectable Turn-InsOf course, when we get down to the nitty gritty details, a good old fashioned collectable turn-in spree does the trick. Feel free to choose any current content turn-in to get scrips, as any income in this regard is a positive. If you ask my opinion, here’s my top tier turn ins for Endwalker: Rarefied Giant Popoto Pancakes (Culinarian): Only requires 4 main materials, but also includes two pre-crafts. Double the crafting, but honestly very much cruise control for scrips. You can very much get away with quick synthing the base materials and macro crafting the collectables. Rarefied Integral Armillae (Carpenter): Another quick and easy alternative, though a bit heavy on the crystal costs, you’ll also need to whip out the weaver for some of the precrafted materials Rarefied Draught (Alchemist): Quick, Easy, but requires combat to farm materials! To make this most effective, you can do fates in any area to collect Bicolor Gemstones and trade them to the vendor in Labrynthos (Faezbroez) for the required Berkanan Sap! Otherwise, you’ll need to farm the drop from Berkanans in Labrynthos instead.

Look no further; I’ve got you covered with my comprehensive Crafting Guide and Leveling Guide! In this guide, I’ll show you how to quickly level all your crafter classes from 1 to 90.If you’re new to crafting, don’t worry - I’ll provide macros to do most of the heavy lifting. And if you want to skip the grind, I’ll share some tips for buying the gear and materials needed for Grade 4 Ishgard Restoration recipes on the Market Board. With my suggested equipment and macros, you’ll breeze through the leveling process and gain huge EXP bonuses.Whether you choose to level all your classes together or one at a time, I’ve got you covered. Plan your inventory space accordingly, and let’s get crafting!PrerequisitesBefore diving into crafting in Final Fantasy XIV, there are a few prerequisites you need to fulfill to ensure a smooth journey. Here are the essential requirements: Main Class Level 70+: To access The Firmament and begin crafting, you must have your main class at level 70 or above. Additionally, you must have completed the Stormblood Main Scenario to gain access to The Firmament. Tools: Your Main Hand and Off-Hand tools will help carry most of the stat requirements we need to craft. They can easily be purchased from various NPCs in the game. If you don’t have access to the required NPCs, you’ll rely on the Market Board to obtain tools instead. Engineering Manuals: You’ll need access to Engineering Manuals to provide a +50% boost to EXP during Levels 1-21. While these manuals can be used at any level, they are most vital at these levels as nearly all EXP is awarded from crafting. The easiest way to obtain Engineering Manuals is by using Grand Company Seals. HQ Tsai tou Vounou Food: You will need to stock up on High-Quality Tsai tou Vounou, the food of choice for our macros due to their great Control and CP bonuses. 3-5 Million Gil: You’ll need some starting funds to purchase gear, tools, materia, food, and materials to prepare for the journey from 1-80. While these numbers are not absolutely required, it is nice to have! Besides, you don’t mind gathering it all yourself, do you?In fulfilling these prerequisites, you’ll be well-prepared to embark on your crafting journey and level up your crafter classes from 1-90. This guide can be followed to the end without completing the Shadowbringers or Endwalker Story Quests, thanks to Ishgardian Restoration – Great news for all you players who want to stretch the game out as much as possible!Levels 1 - 21Ishgard Restoration &amp; The DiademGearsetsCrafting Recipes &amp; MacroLevels 21 - 41GearsetsCrafting Recipes &amp; MacroLevels 41 - 53GearsetsCrafting Recipes &amp; MacroLevels 53 - 63GearsetsCrafting Recipes &amp; MacroLevels 63 - 73Levels 71 - 78Levels 78 - 81Levels 81 - 85Levels 85 - 90What Comes Next?" }, { "title": "Expert Crafting", "url": "/posts/Expert_Crafting/", "categories": "CRAFTING, EXPERT CRAFTING", "tags": "tutorial", "date": "2021-01-28 04:15:22 -0500", "snippet": " If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe - Carl SaganExpert CraftingExpert Crafts were originally designed to be some of the most complicated crafts, with...", "content": " If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe - Carl SaganExpert CraftingExpert Crafts were originally designed to be some of the most complicated crafts, with Higher than normal Quality maximums and strict gear requirements. With the addition of 6.0 Endwalker, things have certainly gotten easier in time. This guide aims to explain the basics behind Expert Crafting and serve as an entry point for anyone looking to get started or fine tune their process.ConditionsThere are no Excellent or Poor conditions with Expert Crafting, but there are 5 new status conditions to watch out for: Centered - Increases action success rate by 25% Sturdy - Reduces loss of durability by 50% (Can stack with Waste Not) Pliant - Reduces CP cost by 50% Malleable - Increases to progress are 1.5 times higher than normal (be careful, it multiplies not adds on buffs so it’s slightly stronger than veneration) Primed - Next status granted by an action will last 2 additional stepsCrafting Phasesgraph LRA{Opener Phase} --&gt; B{Quality Phase}B --&gt; C((Finishing Steps))Opener PhaseThe Opener Phase is where you ideally want to build up as much progress as you can, start Inner Quiet, and have Manipulation up depending on your Condition RNG. For this you’ll be focusing on item conditions, using skills and buffs as you make your way towards Progress completion. You’ll want to repeat these steps until you are one progress skill away from completing your craft. It doesn’t matter what skill you use to complete the craft in the Finishing Phase (Basic Synth, Careful Synth, etc.), the key thing to remember is not to complete the craft before completing your Quality Phase!graph LRJ((Start)) --&gt; AJ --&gt; CJ --&gt; EJ --&gt; GA[Centered, Sturdy, Primed, Normal] --&gt; B{Rapid Synth}C[Malleable] -- Final Appraisal --&gt; BE[Pliant] --&gt; F((Manipulation)) --&gt; IF -- If Already Used --&gt; K{Inner Quiet}E -- End of Opener? --&gt; BG[Good] --&gt; H[Tricks of the Trade] --&gt; IG -- Max CP? --&gt; BB --&gt; I((Check Condition))Quality PhaseThe Quality Phase is easily the most complicated portion of these Expert Crafts. Your goal during this portion is to build 11 stacks of Inner Quiet, while maintaining your Crafting Points (CP), and making sure you don’r run out of Durability.
