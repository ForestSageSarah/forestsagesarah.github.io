Getting Started Quest NPC Location An Original Improvement Chora-Zoi Crystarium (X:7.8, Y:11.4) This Quest Has Prerequisites: The Crystalline Mean The Boutique Always Wins Level 90 Disciple of the Land/Hand Your first task is to head on over to the Crystarium and locate Chora-Zoi. From there you’ll reunite with some familiar faces at the Crystaline mean. After a cute cutscene or two, you’ll be rewarded with a Splendorous Coffer that will take the shape of whatever main hand that is for the DoL/DoH class you were on when you opened it. Much like your local drug dealer, the first one is free and only enough to get you hooked. You’ll need to cough up some scrips for the rest of the set - 1500 White Scrips per Tool. Honestly, diabolical marketing by Mowen and the rest of the House of Splendors here. Does my little lala heart good~ Upgrading to Augmented Splendorous Tools Chora-Zoi is excited to begin improvements on those Splendorus tools you just received. So excited, in fact, she has a quest for you! Quest NPC Location A Dedicated Tool Chora-Zoi Crystarium (X:10.5, Y:7.7) Crafters Each Connoisseur’s turn-in will reqire items you can only obtain with, you guessed it, 50 White Scrips per item. Plan to use a total of at least 1000 White Scrips per Job on this step. Thankfully these aren’t Expert Crafts, so you’re safe from that torture… for now… 20 ‘Perfect’ collectable crafts (+900 Collectablity) should net you the 60 items you need for your job. Otherwise you’ll find yourself crafting 60 items to get the 60 splenderous components. If you find yourself barely meeting the requirements for the task, make sure to use Food and Tinctures/Draughts to help you reach better heights! Gatherers For your Miner and Botanist jobs, you’ll need to collect 180 of Connoisseur’s Primstone &amp; Connoisseur’s Wattle Petribark, respectively, while using your new Splendorous tools. Thier locations can be found by following the links or by checking out your Gathering Log in game, under the Sidequest section. For your Fishing task, you’ll be catching 120 fish instead. With your Splendorous Rod equipped, you’ll need to net yourself a Clavekeeper (+283 Collectablity) or Platinum Seahorse (+47 Collectablity) using a Select Bait Ball - convienently available from Quinnana for 5 Scrips, each. Make sure to turn on Collect before your first cast! By using your resources efficently, such as using Patience II, food, and cordials, you can double your Splendorous Fishing Reel Components that you get for higher collectability. Upgrading to Crystalline Tools After obtaining your first Augmented Splendorous Tool, you’ll be able to undertake another quest from Chroa-Zoi. You’ll only be able to do one job at a time, however Chora-Zoi is eager to continue improving the Splendrous Tools. Something tells me this should be quick and easy! Quest NPC Location An Adaptive Tool Chora-Zoi Crystarium (X:10.5, Y:7.7) Crafters Almost identical to the previous step, you’ll be required to turn in a few more items than last time. Plan to use a total of 1500 White Scrips per Job at least on this step. 30 ‘Perfect’ collectable crafts (+1100 Collectablity) should net you the 90 items you need for your job. Otherwise you’ll find yourself crafting 90 items to get the 90 splenderous components. Gatherers For your Miner and Botanist jobs, you’ll need to collect 180 of Connoisseur’s Red Malachite &amp; Connoisseur’s Levin Mint (+570 Collectability), respectively, while using your new Augmented Splendorous tools. Thier locations can be found by following the links or by checking out your Gathering Log in game, as done previously. Fishers, you’ll be catching fish once more (Surprise!). With your Augmented Splendorous Rod equipped, you’ll need to net yourself a Spangled Pirarucu (+425 Collectability) or Mirror Image (+9 Collectablity) this time, still using a Select Bait Ball - available from Quinnana for 5 Scrips, each. Remember to have Collect on and use your skills! Getting White Scrips Don’t forget those weekly Custom Deliveries! If you forgot that M’naago, Adkiragh, Kai-Shirr, and the others existed - don’t worry I get a bit distracted with saving the world and all too! If you’re low on scrips and want a quick boost to get you started, these weekly quests are a great way to get a jump on things. Even if you decide that these weekly quests are the only way you’re making any sort of scrip income, its a great passive way to get a relic or two done a week. Collectable Turn-Ins Of course, when we get down to the nitty gritty details, a good old fashioned collectable turn-in spree does the trick. Feel free to choose any current content turn-in to get scrips, as any income in this regard is a positive. If you ask my opinion, here’s my top tier turn ins for Endwalker: Rarefied Giant Popoto Pancakes (Culinarian): Only requires 4 main materials, but also includes two pre-crafts. Double the crafting, but honestly very much cruise control for scrips. You can very much get away with quick synthing the base materials and macro crafting the collectables. Rarefied Integral Armillae (Carpenter): Another quick and easy alternative, though a bit heavy on the crystal costs, you’ll also need to whip out the weaver for some of the precrafted materials Rarefied Draught (Alchemist): Quick, Easy, but requires combat to farm materials! To make this most effective, you can do fates in any area to collect Bicolor Gemstones and trade them to the vendor in Labrynthos (Faezbroez) for the required Berkanan Sap! Otherwise, you’ll need to farm the drop from Berkanans in Labrynthos instead." /><meta property="og:description" content="If you were itching for a new challenge, 6.35’s latest additions brings the Crystalline Tools into play for Crafters and Gatherers.

Double the crafting, but honestly very much cruise control for scrips. You can very much get away with quick synthing the base materials and macro crafting the collectables.</p><li><p><strong>Rarefied Integral Armillae (<em>Carpenter</em>)</strong>: Another quick and easy alternative, though a bit heavy on the crystal costs, you’ll also need to whip out the weaver for some of the precrafted materials</p><li><p><strong>Rarefied Draught (<em>Alchemist</em>)</strong>: Quick, Easy, but requires combat to farm materials! To make this most effective, you can do fates in any area to collect Bicolor Gemstones and trade them to the vendor in Labrynthos (<em>Faezbroez</em>) for the required Berkanan Sap! Otherwise, you’ll need to farm the drop from Berkanans in Labrynthos instead.</p></ol></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/crafting/'>CRAFTING</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/tutorial/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >tutorial</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Splendorous%20Tools%20(6.35%20Crafting%20And%20Gathering%20Relics)%20-%20Zodiark's%20Embrace&url=https%3A%2F%2Fzodiarksembrace.com%2Fposts%2FSplendorous_Tools%2F" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Splendorous%20Tools%20(6.35%20Crafting%20And%20Gathering%20Relics)%20-%20Zodiark's%20Embrace&u=https%3A%2F%2Fzodiarksembrace.com%2Fposts%2FSplendorous_Tools%2F" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://t.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fzodiarksembrace.com%2Fposts%2FSplendorous_Tools%2F&text=Splendorous%20Tools%20(6.35%20Crafting%20And%20Gathering%20Relics)%20-%20Zodiark's%20Embrace" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Telegram"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <i id="copy-link" class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link" data-title-succeed="Link copied successfully!"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"><div class="panel-heading">Recently Updated</div><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/EO_Guide/">Eureka Orthos -
