## Expert Crafting

Expert crafting exists to remove the illusion that crafting in Final Fantasy XIV is solved. These recipes were designed to resist macro automation, enforce resource awareness, and reward the crafter who understands why an action is chosen rather than merely when.

While later expansions have softened the gear requirements and expanded available tools, the underlying structure of expert crafts has remained intact. Success is not determined by memorization, but by adaptation.

This guide outlines the systems that govern expert crafting and the principles that make it manageable.

---

## What Makes a Craft “Expert”

Expert recipes differ from standard crafts in three important ways:

- Higher quality ceilings, requiring deliberate quality investment
- Unpredictable conditions, replacing Excellent and Poor
- Narrow margins, where mismanagement compounds quickly

These elements shift the focus from execution to evaluation. Every step asks a question. The craft ends when you stop answering them correctly.

---

## Conditions

Expert crafting replaces traditional condition states with five specialized statuses. These conditions are the primary source of variance and opportunity.

There are no Excellent or Poor conditions. Instead, the following states appear:

### Centered
Increases action success rate by **25%**.

Centered reduces risk. It does not increase output, but it enables consistency when using actions with failure chance.

### Sturdy
Reduces durability loss by **50%**.

Sturdy stacks multiplicatively with effects such as *Waste Not*, allowing extended setup and safer progress advancement.

### Pliant
Reduces CP cost by **50%**.

Pliant is the primary window for high-efficiency CP spending. Poor use of this condition often leads to late-stage instability.

### Malleable
Increases progress gains by **1.5×**.

Malleable multiplies progress bonuses rather than adding to them. While powerful, it must be managed carefully to avoid premature completion.

### Primed
Extends the duration of the next status applied by an action by **2 additional steps**.

Primed rewards foresight. Its value depends entirely on what follows.

---

## Resources and Constraints

Expert crafting is governed by three finite resources:

- Durability  
- CP  
- Remaining progress  

These resources are interdependent. The purpose of most actions is not immediate gain, but future flexibility.

A craft typically fails when one resource collapses before the others can compensate.

---

## A Practical Decision Framework

Expert crafting favors a repeated evaluation loop rather than a fixed sequence.

1. Evaluate progress  
2. Evaluate durability  
3. Evaluate CP  
4. Evaluate condition  

Each step informs whether the current action should stabilize, prepare, or commit.

---

## Progress Management

Progress should be advanced deliberately. Overshooting progress is a common and costly error.

Strong progress actions are best reserved for catching up, exploiting Malleable, or setting a controlled finish.

---

## Quality Investment

Quality is most effectively gained during favorable conditions. Early overcommitment often results in CP depletion without sufficient return.

Successful crafts tend to build slowly and cash out decisively.

---

## Durability Recovery

Durability recovery increases available decision space. Its value lies not in the recovery itself, but in what the recovered steps enable.

Recovery without purpose frequently results in wasted resources.

## Post-Endwalker vs Ishgard Restoration Expert Crafting

Although the mechanics of expert crafting remain consistent, the experience differs notably between the Ishgard Restoration era and post-Endwalker content.

### Ishgard Restoration Era

During the Ishgard Restoration, expert crafting emphasized **scarcity and precision**.

- Gear requirements were strict, often requiring near-optimal melds
- CP margins were tight, amplifying the consequences of early mistakes
- Fewer recovery tools were available, making stabilization more difficult
- Success favored conservative pacing and discipline

Failure during this period was often irreversible once momentum was lost.

### Post-Endwalker Era

Post-Endwalker expert crafting places greater emphasis on **systems literacy** than raw stat pressure.

- Higher baseline stats reduce early volatility
- Expanded toolkits offer more recovery and flexibility
- Mistakes are more survivable, but inefficiency still compounds
- Success favors deliberate exploitation of conditions rather than rigid caution

While more forgiving, post-Endwalker crafts still punish autopilot and reward restraint.

### Practical Implications

Players transitioning from Ishgard-era expert crafting may find post-Endwalker crafts more flexible but easier to misplay through overconfidence. The system remains intact; only the margins have widened.

Expert crafting is still won by awareness, not aggression.

---

## Common Failure Patterns

- Early overcommitment
- Accidental progress completion
- Condition tunnel vision

Most failures trace back to ignoring one of the three core resources.

---

## Practice and Improvement

Improvement comes from post-run analysis rather than repetition.

After each failure, identify which resource failed first and why recovery was no longer possible.

---

## Closing Thoughts

Expert crafting is not designed to be comfortable. It exists to reward patience, awareness, and restraint.

When the craft feels difficult, it is functioning as intended.

Mastery comes when the process feels conversational rather than chaotic.
