# Deep Dungeon PT 1-20 — Floorset Guide

This guide covers **Floors 1–20** of Pilgrims Traverse, split into two difficulty bands. Early floors introduce mechanics safely, while Floors 11–20 escalate damage, enemy density, and mimic risk.

---

## PT 1-10 Overview

| Floors | Rooms | Enemies | Chests | Mimics | Hoard Reward |
|------|------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| 1-10 | 3-6 | 2-3 | 4-6 | Bronze chests on 7-10 | Sack of Silvered Light |

**Respawn Timer:** 1 minute

### Key Notes

- Floors **1-6** have **no bronze chests**, therefore **no mimics**.
- Floors 1-6 do not drop:
  - Alteration
  - Purity
  - Serenity
  - Purification
  - Raising
  - Devotion
- Silver chests can drop incense starting on Floor 1.
- Pomanders of **Affluence**, **Flight**, and **Alteration** do not drop on Floor 9.
- Bronze chests in this set do **not** drop potsherds.

Early floors can hurt through overlapping AoEs but rarely kill outright. Mimic *Deathtrap* is the only lethal mechanic introduced here and only appears later in the set.

## PT 11-20 Overview

| Floors | Rooms | Enemies | Chests | Mimics | Hoard Reward |
|------|------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| 11-20 | 3-6 | 2-3 | 4-6 | Bronze chests 11-19 | Sack of Silvered Light |

**Respawn Timer:** 1 minute

### Key Notes

- Mimics can appear from bronze chests on Floors **11-19**.
- Floors **11-13** do **not** drop potsherds from bronze chests.
- Pomanders of **Affluence**, **Flight**, and **Alteration** do not drop on Floor 19.
