## Quick checklist
- Plan roulettes and weekly resets around the window (*Savage Raids, Deep Dungeon runs, etc.*)
- Wrap up any activities (*ventures, crafting in progress, dungeons*)
- Log out in a safe area before downtime (*I recommend the nearest inn room!*)
- Expect Companion app and Mogstation services to be unavailable
