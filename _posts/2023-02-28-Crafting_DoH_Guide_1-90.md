Hey there, adventurer!

Are you ready to level up your crafting classes in Final Fantasy XIV Endwalker? Look no further; I've got you covered with my comprehensive **Crafting Guide** and **Leveling Guide**! In this guide, I'll show you how to quickly *level all your crafter classes from **1 to 90***.
If you're new to crafting, don't worry - I'll provide macros to do most of the heavy lifting. And if you want to skip the grind, I'll share some tips for buying the gear and materials needed for Grade 4 Ishgard Restoration recipes on the Market Board. With my suggested equipment and macros, you'll breeze through the leveling process and gain huge EXP bonuses.
Whether you choose to level all your classes together or one at a time, I've got you covered. Plan your inventory space accordingly, and let's get crafting!

## Prerequisites

Before diving into crafting in Final Fantasy XIV, there are a few prerequisites you need to fulfill to ensure a smooth journey. Here are the essential requirements:
- **Main Class Level 70+**: To access The Firmament and begin crafting, you must have your main class at level 70 or above. Additionally, you must have completed the *Stormblood Main Scenario* to gain access to The Firmament.
- **Tools**: Your Main Hand and Off-Hand tools will help carry most of the stat requirements we need to craft. They can easily be purchased from various NPCs in the game. If you don't have access to the required NPCs, you'll rely on the Market Board to obtain tools instead.
- **Engineering Manuals**: You'll need access to Engineering Manuals to provide a +50% boost to EXP during Levels 1-21. While these manuals can be used at any level, they are most vital at these levels as nearly all EXP is awarded from crafting. The easiest way to obtain Engineering Manuals is by using Grand Company Seals.
- **HQ Tsai tou Vounou Food**: You will need to stock up on High-Quality Tsai tou Vounou, the food of choice for our macros due to their great Control and CP bonuses.
- **3-5 Million Gil**: You'll need some starting funds to purchase gear, tools, materia, food, and materials to prepare for the journey from 1-80. While these numbers are not absolutely required, it is nice to have! Besides, you don't mind gathering it all yourself, do you?

In fulfilling these prerequisites, you'll be well-prepared to embark on your crafting journey and level up your crafter classes from 1-90. This guide can be followed to the end without completing the *Shadowbringers* or *Endwalker* Story Quests, thanks to Ishgardian Restoration -- Great news for all you players who want to stretch the game out as much as possible!
